Change from streamengine.net to native:
	Create interops only for the functions that are needed

Add headtracking?
	Separate class? Separate lib?

Singelton tracker:
	Eyetracker can read from static/singelton fields so all instances read from same place.
	we need some ref-counter to dispose the singelton when last instance is destroyed.  

Testproject:
	If headtracking / singelton / etc might be time to add tests?
